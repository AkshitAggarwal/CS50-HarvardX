# CS50-HarvardX

#Since June-2018, I have been taking an introductory Computer Science course from Harvard Online, the course is taught my Dr. David J. malan, it's not like any other introductory course as it gets really challenging after a while. But by the end of it I'm sure a lot will be learnt. I have only completed three weeks of it and I can write Sorting Algorithms. 

#This repo will consist of projects and code that I have been writing for the problem sets and practice for that course. 

#The following technologies/languages are used for this course progressively.
  1. Scratch (Week 0) The MIT designed software to make coding simpler, a Drag & Drop software to execute interactive programs.
  2. C (Week 1-3) This course starts it's real programming with C language as it's very close to the system, the goal of this course is 
     not entirely to teach us how to code but to understand how computers work. How the bits, the 0s and 1s work altogether. 
  3. Python. Of course, what computer science introductory course doesn't have Python these days, later after going throught the trouble        while learning how C works we dive into a more advanced language called Python to see how easily some code can be executed with the        pre-existing libraries that have been created for us. 
  4. HTML/CSS/Javascript. The course ends with a little introduction to Web Development, using the basic three languages we will                understand how web-apps can be created.
